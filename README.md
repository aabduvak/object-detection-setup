Welcome to our Object Detection project powered by YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm. YOLOv8, or "You Only Look Onece," is renowned for its speed and accuracy, making it a robust choice for identifying and localizing multiple objects simultaneously.

Our project leverages the YOLOv8 algorithm to detect objects in images and videos, providing efficient and precise results. From detecting common objects to more complex scenarios, our implementation is designed to handle a variety of use cases with ease.

Key Features:

    Real-time object detection
    High accuracy across diverse scenarios
    Support for various object classes
    Seamless integration with image and video inputs

Whether you're exploring computer vision, enhancing surveillance systems, or incorporating object detection into your applications, our YOLOv8-based project offers a powerful solution. Join us on the journey of pushing the boundaries of object detection technology.
